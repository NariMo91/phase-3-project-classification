    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Asteroids are rocky bodies that come in a variety of sizes, ranging from just a few meters to hundreds of kilometers in diameter. Although the chance of a particular asteroid impacting the earth in the short term is quite low, a major impact is inevitable on the scale of millenia. We are all familiar with the asteroid impact that caused a global extinction event in the Middle Miocene period about 16 million years ago. Thankfully, these events seem to occur on a 26 million year cycle. The main poster child of planetary defense is the Tsunguska Event of 1908, in which a 10,000 metric ton asteroid exploded over Sibera, Russia with the energy of 2,000 Hiroshima-sized nuclear weapons. The Tsunguska Event is a better example of the types of impacts we may have to contend with in the near future. An updated understanding Tsunguska and other events has inspired modern efforts to detect potentially hazardous asteroids and develop the technology to neutralize the threats they impose.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Methods that are currently being studied for impact mitigation include:\n",
    "- Gravity tractor: spacecraft or device will fly alongside the asteroid in order to pull it off Earth's path using gravity.\n",
    "- Kinetic impactor: one or more large, high-speed spacecraft will deflect the asteroid into a different trajectory.\n",
    "- Blast deflection: launch a nuclear explosive (or other kind) to disrupt, deflect, or destroy a near earth asteroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any one of these impact-response plans would require sufficient preparation and execution time (up to 20 years or more), so early detection is key. The result of this project is a Random Forest classification model with a high recall score that can help flag potentially hazardous asteroids based on their various characteristics."

    "# Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "NASA's NEO Observations Program sponsors projects related to planetary defense and is tasked with finding, tracking, and characterizing NEOs. Classification models can flag potentially hazardous asteroids as updates are made to the MPC (Minor Planet Center) so that the CNEOS (Center for Near-Earth Object Studies) can implement timely follow-up studies, tracking their orbits and analyze their possible future positions relative to Earth. A classification model should prioritize recall/sensitivity for the positive class to ensure that any asteroid that is truly potentially hazardous is properly identified."

Outliers were removed from the features with the heighest weights in Iteration 2, and the resultant data from this step was used in the tree-based models. A multicolinearity check revealed that many features were highly correlated with each other, with most pairs having correlation above 0.94. Removal of these features did not seem to improve model performance at all. After comparing Iteration 3 (no outliers or overfitting) with a baseline decision tree, it was clear that logistic regression was not going to be the best-performaing model for this dataset.\n",

Standard scaling was included in a pipeline for each iteration, which brought the feature means to 0 with a standard deviation of 1. The baseline model was overfit and had a `max_depth` of 18. Iterations 2-4 implemented tree pruning by searching for `max_depth` values less than 18 and larger values for `min_samples_leaf` and `min_samples_split` while prioritizing recall: `True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)`. The objective here was to correctly identify as many asteroids that are truly potentially hazardous as possible, i.e. minimize false negatives. At Iteration 4, continuing to gridsearch while prioritizing recall only increased the number of false positives (non-hazardous asteroids misclassified as potentially hazardous) with no benefit to recall of the positive class.

Iteration 3 showed the same recall score for the positive class as Iteration 2, but the number of false positives increased from 97 to 489. Like with the decision tree, continuing to gridsearch with lower values for `max_depth` seemed to reduce precision with no increase in recall. Iteration 4 omitted `max_depth` = 6, the lowest value, in order to grow out the trees and help address the high number of false positives. Iteration 4 was the best-performing iteration.\n",

The model missed only 2 potentially hazardous asteroids while misclassifying 97 non-hazardous asteroids as potentially hazardous.

    "The model can be improved as updates are made to the data held by the JPL Small-Body Database. For example, there were 800K+ missing values for `albedo` and `diameter`. If more data were to be gathered on the physical properties of these asteroids, like `albedo`, `albedo` and `H` could be used to estimate `diameter` and more potentially useful features could be included in the training of a classification model. Also, the addition of more asteroids with known labels could only help the model."
